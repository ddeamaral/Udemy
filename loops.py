# Loops

# a loop is a way to make a code block execute, repeatedly

# Example:
emails = ['me@gmail.com', 'you@hotmail.com', 'they@gmail.com']
# stores each email in email, and allows you to do something with each email
for email in emails:

    # looking for gmail in each email. Only prints emails with gmail in them
    if 'gmail' in item:
        print(email)
